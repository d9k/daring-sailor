## Save game

- (and generated map)

- I don't like the rigidness of plain C `struct`. You add one field and deserialization of existing savegame file is broken.

- :speaking_head_in_silhouette: I want to store not `{ value1, value2, value3 }` but `{ key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3  }` (types of values can be arbitrary, they must be handled manually on deserialization) / [d9k](https://discord.com/channels/768759024270704641/831589248239009832/1309704497001529464)

### Serialize c++ structures

#### :black_square_button: C++ 11 serializer

- [c-plus-plus-serializer](https://github.com/goblinhack/c-plus-plus-serializer?tab=readme-ov-file#user-defined-class-serialization) by [goblinhack](https://github.com/goblinhack)
	- _A minimal C++11 header only serializer. Can serialize basic types, strings, containers, maps and custom classes. No suppprt yet for pointer types._
	- [ ] I have simple probably genius idea: https://github.com/goblinhack/c-plus-plus-serializer + [custom class](https://github.com/goblinhack/c-plus-plus-serializer?tab=readme-ov-file#user-defined-class-serialization) with fields `std::map<string, int> ints`, `std::map<string, strings> strings` etc for each data type required by the game
		- [ ] Also  game version will be saved to `strings.version`  to apply migrations to savegame data.
		- [ ] Also `#define`s can be used to balance code readability, savegame binary readability and savegame size, for example `#define INTS_KEY_HEALTH 'h'`

#### :black_square_button: palimpsest

- [palimpsest](https://github.com/stephane-caron/palimpsest) by [stephane-caron](https://github.com/stephane-caron)

- Serialize to and deserialize from¬†[MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/)
- _Fast serializable C++ dictionaries_
- can be used at runtime
- New type must be declared at :open_file_folder: `src/mpack/Writer.cpp`
- smth. like Redux store
- `sudo apt install libeigen3-dev libfmt-dev libspdlog-dev`
- :speaking_head_in_silhouette: [How to remove single item from Dictionary? | issue #10 | palimpsest](https://github.com/stephane-caron/palimpsest/issues/10)
	- Seems to be fixed at [TRUEPIC/cborg](https://github.com/TRUEPIC/cborg):
- serialize vector?
- need to cut out Eigen support
- need to add for every new type code in `include/palimpsest/{json,pack}/riter.h`

	- just BASE64
		- [yEnc - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YEnc)
			- The yEnc homepage states that "_all major newsreaders have been extended to yEnc support_"
			- yEnc assumes that binary data mostly can be transmitted through Usenet and email. Therefore, 252 of the 256 possible bytes are passed through unencoded as a single byte. Only NUL, LF, CR, and = are escaped.

#### JSON

- _Your binary serialization library_
- x3 faster then messagepack
- [Motivation](https://github.com/fraillt/bitsery/blob/master/doc/design/README.md)
	- I wanted serializer that is easy to use as¬†[cereal](http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/), is cross-platform compatible, and has support for forward/backward compatibility like¬†[flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/), is safe to use with untrusted (malicious) data, and most importantly is fast and has a small binary footprint.
	- Furthermore, I wanted full serialization control and the ability to work on a bit level, so I can further reduce data size.

#### BerkleyDB

- :speech_balloon: [For anyone thinking Berkeley DB, because it has transactions and logging, is a g... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10150394)
	- Its tools are crap: it can't tell you how big a database is without traversing every single entry, they hold locks while writing to the terminal (meaning you can't pipe them into a pager without freezing the whole DB), and if one of them crashes (due to e.g. a dropped SSH connection) they'll bring down the whole DB due to stale locks.

	- _The smallest sqlite3 I came up with was 327 KBytes (for PowerPC), which was sufficient for the system so I stopped trying to make it smaller. This was the full sqlite3 CLI binary, the C APIs alone would have been somewhat smaller. I had set `SQLITE_OMIT_AUTHORIZATION`, `SQLITE_OMIT_EXPLAIN`, `SQLITE_OMIT_PROGRESS_CALLBACK`, and `SQLITE_OMIT_TCL_VARIABLE` to trim the size of the binary, and used `-Os`to get it to that size._
